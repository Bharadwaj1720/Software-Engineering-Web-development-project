# ERP modules

## Introduction:

README	

This project contains the client-side and server-side code for an ERP system with four modules:
library
health
general administration
research
The website has been built using the MERN stack
Install reactjs.
Install nodejs.
The user must clone the repositories locally into his/her machine. 
Run command: npx create-react-app newapp.
The package.json file contains all the dependencies required to run the project, therefore the user must use the command: npm install, within the SERVER folder to get all the dependencies locally.
The user must access the CLIENT folder inside the repo, and run the command: 				npm install bootstrap.
Now, the user can initialize the database with random values appropriately by using the commands:
cd server
node init_db
These commands fill up the database with values, enabling the user to access the website with preloaded data, however the user is free to access the website with an empty database too!
Now, the user can run the backend-server using the following commands:
cd server
node server
Finally the user may start the website by running the following commands:
cd client
npm start
